# Enforce-Script-Extensions
A collection of new data types, methods, aliases etc. for Arma Reforger to help streamline the scripting experience.

For full documentation, [see the wiki](https://github.com/NarcoMarshDev/Enforce-Script-Extensions/wiki).
# Installation
__I DO NOT RECOMMEND INSTALLING ESE IN THIS PRERELEASE STATE AS A FULL PROJECT__

ESE will be released on the workshop at a date TBA, for now I would simply browse through the files and take any methods you want and copy them to your own project. If you do want to use it as a full project however, clone this repo and add it as an existing project in the enfusion workbench, BUT BE CAREFUL! Things are changing a lot still, and using these pre-release versions may cause compatibility issues when it releases. I would hightly recommend renaming all the files and classes to "OLD_ESE..." so they remain seperate from release versions.
# Supporting ESE In Your Mod
ESE just needs to be added as a dependency in your mod to work, but if you want to add your own aliases for your custom resources, see the wiki for a [guide](https://github.com/NarcoMarshDev/Enforce-Script-Extensions/wiki/Adding-Custom-Aliases-In-Your-Mod) to add your own aliases using a simple modded class.
