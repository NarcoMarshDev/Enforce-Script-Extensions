# Installation
ESE can be downloaded from the Arma Reforger workshop and added as a dependency in your project, this installation will recieve automatic updates as they are published to the workshop. Due to the potential major changes at this early stage of development however, be ready to make changes to your implementation of ESE in your projects as **future compatibility isn't yet garunteed until version 1.0**
# Supporting ESE In Your Mod
ESE just needs to be added as a dependency in your mod to work, but if you want to add your own aliases for your custom resources, see the wiki for a [guide](https://github.com/NarcoMarshDev/Enforce-Script-Extensions/wiki/Adding-Custom-Aliases-In-Your-Mod) to add your own aliases using a simple modded class.
